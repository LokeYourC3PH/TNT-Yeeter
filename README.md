# TNT Yeeter Mod
Adds a TNT Yeeter mob that throws TNT at you.
[This mod was inspired by a Reddit post by u/6ranolabar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/cq0mgn/i_made_a_tnt_yeeter/)

The mod will receive continued, but limited development by me, as the original developer has ceased development.
A quick shoutout to the original mod developer, ModdingLegacy. You can find the original mod here:

üí£ What does this mod do?

This mod adds an entity called the TNT Yeeter. You can spawn it with a spawn egg or with the summon command. It‚Äôs a planned feature to spawn the TNT Yeeter by building the original structure!

The TNT Yeeter attacks player and cows right now. Later on we can add some configuration options to choose what he attacks. Or if anyone has ideas, leave them in the comments!
